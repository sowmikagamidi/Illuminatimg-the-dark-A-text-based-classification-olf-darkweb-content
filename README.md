🕵️‍♂️ Dark Web Malicious Service Classification using Topic Modelling + Deep Learning

This project focuses on identifying malicious services on the Dark Web using advanced topic modelling and deep learning techniques.
The Dark Web, known for providing anonymity, has increasingly become a hotspot for illegal markets, cyber threats, and various malicious services—making effective monitoring a major challenge.

Traditional text-classification approaches like TF-IDF, Document Matrix, and Latent Semantic Analysis often struggle with noisy or irrelevant data, resulting in reduced detection accuracy.
To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid LDA-Deep Learning architecture capable of capturing contextual, semantic, and topic-level patterns in Dark Web content.

🚀 Project Overview
🔍 Objective

To develop a robust classification model capable of identifying Dark Web services associated with malicious activities using enriched topic-based features and deep learning.
